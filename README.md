## 🙋‍♂️ Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Aman Yadav**, a Full-Stack Developer and a B.Tech undergrad at Government Engineering College Ajmer.  
Back when I created this (around a year ago), I was just getting started with HTML, and CSS.

This repo was my first attempt to introduce myself through code!

## 💡 What’s Inside?

This was a simple webpage all about me, including:

- My **introduction**
- My **interests and hobbies**
- Some **basic styling and layout** (They are awfull)

It may be simple and cringe for you, but it's special to me 💙  
It reminds me how far I've come — from writing basic HTML to now building fullstack scalable web-applications.

---

## 📌 Final Thoughts

This project reminds me that **every expert was once a beginner**.  
If you're just starting out too, don’t be afraid to build something small — just start!
